# isfactor:
 - for loop: 5 points
 - ``vec[i]%n`` 5 points
 - return false if ``vec[i]%n!=0`` for any ``i``: 5 points
 - return true otherewise: 5 points



# mySimplify:
  - use a loop: 5 points
  - the loop starts from or ends at the minimum element: 5 points
  - identify the maximum common factor with the loop: : 5 points
  - modify the vector by dividing each element by their maximum common factor: 5 points
